# PIONEXT Platform

PIONEXT is a hybrid investment platform combining crowdfunding mechanics with automated market making (AMM) through bonding curves. The platform enables builders to raise funds while providing investors with liquid trading opportunities through project-specific app credits.

## Core Features

- **Project Funding**: Builders can raise funds through credit sales
- **Bonding Curves**: Automated price discovery based on supply/demand
- **Credit System**: 
  - Platform credits (PIONEXT) fixed at 1:1 with USD
  - Project-specific credits tradeable through bonding curves
  - Early investors benefit from discounted rates (up to 60% off)
  - Example: Pay 40 PIONEXT ($40) for 100 credits ($100 value)

## Trading Opportunities

- **Early Investor Advantages**:
  - Buy project credits at lower initial prices
  - Sell credits at higher prices as demand grows
  - Reinvest profits into other early-stage projects
  - Build portfolio value through strategic timing
- **Active Trading**:
  - Trade between different project credits
  - Capitalize on price movements through bonding curves
  - No lock-up periods - trade anytime
  - Use profits to access more projects at early stages

## How It Works

### For Builders
1. Register and verify account
2. Submit project details including:
   - Project description
   - Funding goal
   - App credit economics
   - Supporting materials (pitch deck, videos, demos)
   - Credentials/reputation
3. Once approved, launch credit sales

### For Investors
1. Create account
2. Purchase PIONEXT credits (1 PIONEXT = $1 USD)
3. Invest in project credits
4. Trade credits using bonding curves
   - Prices automatically adjust based on supply/demand
   - Early investors benefit from lower initial prices
   - Credits can be traded anytime through the platform

## Technical Stack (MVP)

- Centralized architecture (non-blockchain)
- Data mirroring to Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)
- Standardized bonding curve implementation
- Database-managed credit system

## Platform Limitations (MVP)

Current limitations include:
- No direct fiat currency integration
- No PIONEXT credit cash-out functionality
- No token-to-fiat conversion
- Simplified token economics
- Basic user profiles

## Project Verification

- Projects must apply for listing
- Manual review process by PIONEXT team
- Feedback provided for rejected projects
- Future feature: AI-powered preliminary screening

## Investment Mechanics

- Project app credit prices follow bonding curve formula
- Initial price set at project launch
- Price increases as more credits are purchased
- Price decreases when credits are sold back
- Early investors benefit from:
  - Lower initial app credit prices
  - Potential price appreciation
  - First access to promising projects
